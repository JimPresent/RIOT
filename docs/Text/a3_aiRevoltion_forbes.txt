The AI Revolution
Archil Cheishvili

AI experienced a major boom in the healthcare sector since the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it was not a result of overnight changes, as the industry was increasingly turning tech-focused in the days preceding it.

Artificial intelligence continues to find widespread application in telemedicine, ranging from preliminary diagnosis to formulating a treatment plan. AI platforms can utilize a range of technologies such as data mining, image processing and predictive modeling to discover the best route to a long and healthy life.

From autonomous vehicles to robotic process automation, AI has developed roots and grown offshoots throughout. It is only a matter of time until AI opportunities accelerate through rapid adoption. However, to facilitate this action, businesses require trusted sources to connect with vendors and AI specialists. 

AI marketplaces can satisfy this need by allowing companies to buy or sell AI-powered products and services. These marketplaces can accelerate the speed of innovation in AI and bring the benefits of the AI revolution to the current generation.
