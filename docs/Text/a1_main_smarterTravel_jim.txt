Smarter Travel

TFI Smarter Travel is a national voluntary behaviour change programme, supporting employers and third level institutions to implement voluntary Travel Plans. These plans focus on promoting and encouraging staff and students to sustainably and actively commute and beyond, and for organisations to consider flexible working arrangements. 

A growing number of Irish Third Level Campuses are engaging in Smarter Travel, working with students and employees to facilitate more sustainable travel choices – resulting in better access, enhanced student and employee wellbeing, reduced costs, reduced carbon emissions, and more effective parking management.

The Smarter Travel Student Awards invite students to develop a project that supports, facilitates and/or enables sustainable and active travel modes to, from, and on campus that is relevant to their field of study and interest.

Students from third level colleges around the country were awarded for developing and designing marketing and engineering projects and creating videos, animations, audio, and graphics for the National Transport Authority’s Smarter Travel Campus Awards 2021. Thanks once again to our Judging Panel for taking the time to review the entries this year.
